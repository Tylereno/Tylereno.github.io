## // MISSION PROFILE

Systems Architect and Project Manager bridging the gap between heavy infrastructure and digital intelligence. Proven track record in deploying critical power systems for national EV networks (EVgo) and temporary autonomous microgrids. Combining academic rigor from the West Valley MESA Engineering Program with field-tested survival architecture to build resilient, offline-capable systems for denied/disrupted environments.

## // OPERATIONAL HISTORY

### EVgo | National EV Network
**PROJECT MANAGER (Network Operations)**

Managed deployment logistics for high-voltage DC Fast Charging infrastructure across national markets.

Coordinated cross-functional teams (engineering, construction, utility partners) to ensure site reliability and uptime targets were met.

Optimized project workflows to accelerate grid interconnection and reduce site commissioning latency.

### SUN-WAVE | Expedition Vehicle Systems
**LEAD SYSTEMS ARCHITECT**

Design and fabricate custom "Zero-Dependency" mobile power systems for expedition vehicles and off-grid living.

Architected solar-to-storage topologies using LiFePO4 chemistry and Victron/Renogy integration, eliminating reliance on shore power.

Engineered efficient DC distribution grids to support Starlink/LTE telemetry and onboard compute stacks with minimal power overhead.

### CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (BRC) | Large-Scale Temporary Operations
**POWER LOGISTICS SPECIALIST**

Deployed and maintained multi-megawatt temporary microgrids for a 70,000-person ephemeral city in a hostile desert environment.

Managed fuel logistics and load balancing for high-demand art installations and safety infrastructure.

Executed rapid tear-down and "Leave No Trace" remediation, ensuring 100% asset recovery.

## // STRATEGIC PROJECTS

### PROJECT: ARK NODE | Autonomous Infrastructure Stack

**Objective:** Built a self-healing, offline-first compute node for DDIL (Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, Limited) environments.

**Architecture:** Linux Docker Host running containerized services with hardware watchdog architecture for autonomous recovery.

**Innovation:** Developed a custom Python "Power Governor" to gracefully throttle container loads based on real-time solar voltage telemetry, achieving <100W power draw with 99.9% uptime.

### PROJECT: SMACKOVER RESOURCES | Feasibility Study

**Objective:** Techno-economic analysis of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) in the Arkansas brine region.

**Analysis:** Modeled a closed-loop adsorption system to reduce surface footprint and water usage by 60% compared to evaporation ponds.

**Outcome:** Established unit economics targeting <$4,000/ton production cost via brownfield infrastructure integration.
